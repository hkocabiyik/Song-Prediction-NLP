It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, I'm starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!
Girl, I know you feel this lust
Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us

See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition"

Forget about the obligations

Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?



Ooh, ooh
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just trying to get you back on me

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity
[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to k**
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth

She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight

But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
She said it's her first time (oh,ya,ya)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (oh,ya,ya), and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an headache
Got me twisted (oh,ya,ya), but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves
[Pre-Chorus:]
Then she started dancing, s**ual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident



Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no

I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why (IEH)
I'm addicted, something like an addict (chance)
Got me twisted (the rapper), but still I gotta have it(IEH)
[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or an a**, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her a** on a learning curve
And she latter earn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, here back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains and Icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock & roll
She say, ""I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing.""
Watch her twerk for a goodfella
She money down with the money team
(She's confident)
IGH!
[Chorus:]
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no

Oh no no, oh no no [x4]

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the ba**
Bum bum bum bum

I hit it twice, it's a habit
Don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous
There's storm and no silence to add on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted, give you flowers
Now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin' and to leave this
Bed I'mma need a f**in' ransom man I got her screamin'
""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall
But you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones
And when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever
I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer, I swear

I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone,
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out



What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,
In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless, unless you let yourself fall"

Please don't tell me you're just like them

I never thought that I could take a burn

Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me!
I be trying a chill
They be trying to side with the thrill.
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove.
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water for blood. (lets go)
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyiest.
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant.
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land.

You got stacks like the international house of pancakes
All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is sweat it, don't regret
Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck
It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego
It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us
Fly walls down in the fly halls
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
All about money tied in a know stand over there
That's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta
You see my baby over hit the road
Where she's going I swear nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
I'm just tryin to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool)
What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah)
I'm just tryin to find, find, find
That sweet love of mine

Where is my runway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love
Last name West and my teeth Diamonds
She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?
Listen to Wu Tang
Trying crazy suits on
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's
Shorts is the coogies
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo
Next show they gotta up the zeroes
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me



The young youth rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'
You looking good fly color Asian
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's
(Sweet runaway love)
Guess that's the day she became a runaway love
I'm runnin outta time

Why can't I find, the love of mine,
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine
How did I let you get away
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck
Grabbing em on set
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get
Take that queen a**ure to ya
We can live every month baby girl just call me up
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes
Even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss
Me my lady left my homies
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine
My runaway love give me mine come on
I'm runnin outta time

It's about time for you give to charity,
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,
So I think some of you need to act bold,
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,
Ima drummer boy so do, do
Ima drummer boy so do, do
Ima drummer boy so do, do
Ima drummer boy so do, do
Ima drummer boy so do, do"

Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas
Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pindrop
Cept for the clock on the wall
And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow



Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas
I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
I'll be waiting
Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this christmas
Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight"

A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears



All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time"

Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way



He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you"

And I understand that it's meant to be.
'cause baby when you're with me...
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to heaven)
'cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)
[Chorus:]
Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go
I got my favorite girl
Not feelin', no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor.
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because...

Let's just dance
Watch my feet
Follow me
Don't be scared,
Girl I'm here
If you didn't know,
This is love
Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Praise the doubters on
They don't matter at all (oh, baby)
'cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go
So don't fear.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I am here, by you (I'll never let you go)
Don't shed a tear.
Whenever you need me,
I'll be here (I'll never let you go)
Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)

You wanted me to meet you halfway,

I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space,
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sonny and Cher,
I don't care, I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop.
Now you don't wanna let go,

Saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reach the point of no return
And there's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)
And never say never (ne-never say never)
(Ne-never say never)
(Ne-never say never)
Never say it, never, never say it

I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)
'Cause there's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never (I will fight)

And never say never
Here we go
Guess who?
J-Smith and J-B!
I gotcha lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?



I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me
I be trying to chill
They try to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the fliest
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon is where I land
(I'm gone)
Yeah
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (never say never)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up

And I don't
I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was a destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care
I got you Stuck In The Moment
See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two

And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like
Just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Stuck In The Moment we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeahhhh
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do

This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me
[Outro]
Never gonna let you go, I'm never gonna let you go, go, oh
That should be me, I'm never gonna let you go, that should be me
Never gonna let you go, I'm never gonna let you go, go, oh
That should be me, I'm never gonna let you go, oh"

The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger,
The love, the love is bigger, big
Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale (yeah)
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down (no)
Like a see saw lets you down (oh) you know why
Cause we ain't on the playground no more baby
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear,
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoa, remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby,
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger



And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoa, I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger), I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
Whoa,
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(don't knock ya earrings) like yesterday
(They shine on me) we were little then
(in cla** daydreamed about you) my baby
Just remember
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (hey)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (heart breaker)

And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that i could fear
The only thing that would hurt me, uh
Is if you weren't here, oh
[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compa** at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa
Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game



Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, ""Love is a lie""
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa
[Chorus]
I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'
I'm gonna hold it down for you
You, whoa, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah whoa
I don't wanna to go back...

Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance

When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give your first dance to me

I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)
So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your gla** slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
If you just give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
