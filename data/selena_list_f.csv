I had a dream that you were mine
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
[Verse 1: Hamilton Leithauser]
I left my room on the west side
I walked from noon until the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
My eyes were red, the streets were bright
Those ancient years were black and white
[Pre-Chorus: Hamilton Leithauser & together]
The 10th of November, the year's almost over
If I had your number, I'd call you tomorrow
If my eyes were open, I'd be kicking the doors in
But all that I have is this old dream I've always had
[Chorus: Hamilton Leithauser]
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times



I've had that dream a thousand times
[Verse 2: Hamilton Leithauser]
I left my room on the west side
I walked from noon through the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your old house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
I had a dream that you were mine
I've had that dream a thousand times
[Pre-Chorus: Hamilton Leithauser]
But I don't answer questions, I just keep on guessing
My eyes are still open, the curtains are closing
But all that I have is this old dream I always had
[Chorus: Hamilton Leithauser]
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times"

So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in
Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over



If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet

I've been smoking on the peace pipe
I've been wondering just what would peace be like
I've been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I'm just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone “Unwilling to come undone”

Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it's capsized
It's finally done, the battle's lost yet I feel I've won

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds

Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light

All my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold

It’s like a story of love

Came back only yesterday
I’m moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

When it’s only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It’s getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew

And I wonder what’s mine
Can’t take no more (can’t take no more)
Wonder if you’ll understand
It’s just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day

And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

I swear he had no name

Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down

He bore the marks of time

Your eyes are feet apart
Is that the end you're carrying
Shall I play the funeral march"" (play the march)

Come on down, we'll make the stand

On the hardship that had struck I saw the seven phials open
The plague claimed man and son
Four men at a grave in silence With hats bowed down in grace
A simple wooden cross
It had no epitaph engraved (it had no)
It had no epitaph engraved
Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help



What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you
[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?
[Chorus]
I got so much sh** to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage
[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride
[Chorus]
I got so much sh** to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride"

Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got sh** up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the a** shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

Right now, 'ow

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here



The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call

No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down

The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all

Ready for my ma**age right now
Right now

Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
Yeah, That's more like it
I see where and when it happens
That's more like it!"

Help me DJ, play my favorite song,
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now everybody wants to sing along, sing along,
When the night is here
The only thing on my mind is having a good time when the moon appears

Like the ocean that's running dry

It's like the ground is crumbling
Underneath my feet won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me

So let this drought come to an end
And may this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me

Feel so much better now
Don't even try anymore
Nothing left to lose
There's a voice that's in the air
Saying don't look back nowhere
There's a voice that's always there
And I'll never be
Quite the same as I was before
This part of you still remains
Though it's out of focus
You're just somewhere that I've been
And I won't go back again
You're just somewhere that I've been

The ghost of you
And I'll never be like I was
The day I met you
Too naive, yes I was
Boy that's why I let you win
Wear your memory like a stain
Can't erase or numb the pain
Here to stay with me forever
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about



Living life, crazy loud
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothing left to figure out, but
I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
One of these days I'll wake up from
This bad dream I'm dreaming
One of these days I'll pray that
I'll be over, over, over you
One of these days I'll realize that
I'm so tired of feeling confused
But for now there's a reason that
You're still here in my heart
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about
Living life, crazy loud
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothing left to figure out, but
I don't think I'll ever break through

Made a choice to be the best that I could ever be
Gotta stay positive, ignore the negativity

Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay

So I started living for today



I'm gonna follow my intuition
Telling myself to listen
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It's gonna be a good day
Follow my intuition

Let it come back, it's always easy to know
But sometimes it just gets so confusing
Feel like I don't know what I'm doing
But I trust my hear in any way
Cause could be better at, at everything
You see what's meant to be is gonna happen
You know it's gonna be a good day
I'm gonna follow my intuition
I said it's gonna be a good day
Everything's gonna be okay

Pick up everybody I'll be waiting outside

I hope I get to see ya
Whoa-oh-oh!
The summer won't start without you
The temperature is 99
And I can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
Whoa-oh-oh!

Cada instante, que no estás junto a mí
Mi mundo está al revés
Camino en un desierto cuando tú te vas
No sé si es un espejismo, te siento tan real, baby

Quiero volverte a ver, para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez, no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Contando estrellas, oigo en mi mente tu voz
¿Oyes tu la mía?
Mi corazón esta sufriendo la soledad
Soy un desorden
Camino en hojas secas si no estás aquí, y mi vida

99,Kiss & Tell (2009),As A Blonde,https://lyrics.az/selena-gomez/kiss-tell/as-a-blonde.html,"I was looking in the mirror,
Trying to find, a new reflection.
Wanna take the road less traveled in a different direction.
Make some new mistakes, forget the ones I've made.
Cry some tears of joy, dress more like a boy. And come back as a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde. I wanna I meet myself, as someone else,
Just to see what it feels like.
Take a walk, on the other side,
'Cuz you know that I just might.
Break some different hearts, finish what I start.
I'm not gonna wait, and mess around with fate. And come back as a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so eticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.



Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde. I'm tainted, I'm tired of being the same yeah.
I'm desperate,
I'm bored,
I'm begging for change.
What if you're normal and wanna be strange
Come back, come back, come back.
Come back, come back, come back. As a blonde, try a different lipstick on
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'd be ever so eticing,
Cake a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna come back as a blonde.
Wave my magic wand,
As a blonde, will I get whatever I want?
I'll be ever so enticing,
Down a lot of ice cream, never even wipe my face.
Yeah when I'm gone,
I'm gonna...
Come back, come back, come back,
Come back, come back, come back,
Come back, come back, come back
As a blonde."

When I think of you
And all the things we'll

Just somethin' natural

When you walk in the room
When you're near
I feel my heart skips a beat
The whole world disappears

Falling head over feet

That we're just too young to know,
But I'm sure heart and soul
That I'm never letting you go

Every single time that we kiss
You make the angels sing
You give the songbird wings

I was changin', arrangin' my life to fit your lies.
It's all said and all done.
I gave it all for the long run.
Can she say the same thing?
I guess this is good bye and good luck.
(I can't be what you want me to be) I'm sorry for changing.
I'm sorry it had to be this way.
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend.
But, I won't apologize for who I am. No, no. Remember the time when you said
You were out with your best friend.
But it wasn't the best friend
That you know I thought you meant and
I used to accept it,
I didn't know I could be free.
But I am, and I won't go back
'cause you so don't deserve me.



(I don't even want to be her) I'm sorry for changing.
I'm sorry it had to be this way.
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend.
But, I won't apologize for who I am. I thank you for this hopeless war
Cause through the pain now I'm stronger now than before.
Now I'm more.
I don't need you anymore.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry it had to be this way.

But, I won't apologize for who I am. I'm sorry for changing.
