# Song-Prediction-NLP
#### Builded text classification models (like Naive Bayes) on song lyrics on https://lyrics.az/  (by Web Scraping techniques) 

#### This project is modelling a text classification model on song lyrics. The task is to predict the artist from a piece of text. To train such a model, It is needed to collect your own lyrics dataset:

- Download a HTML page with links to songs

- Extract hyperlinks of song pages

- Download and extract the song lyrics

- Vectorize the text using the Bag Of Words method

- train a classification model that predicts the artist from a piece of text

- refactor the code into functions

- Write a simple command-line interface for the program
